# Tracy: basecalling, alignment, assembly and deconvolution of Sanger Chromatogram trace files

[Tracy](https://github.com/gear-genomics/tracy) is an efficient and versatile command-line application to basecall, align, assemble and deconvolute Sanger Chromatogram trace files. Tracy supports various Chromatogram input file formats (*.ab1, *.abi, *.scf), aligns traces across entire genomes, calls variants and supports as output commonly used NGS file formatics (VCF/BCF, JSON). Tracy's [companion web applications](https://www.gear-genomics.com) enable an interactive exploration of results. All code is open-source and hosted on [Tracy's GitHub page](https://github.com/gear-genomics/tracy).
